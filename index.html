    	I graduated from the University of Michigan College of Engineering with a degree in Computer Science in April 2017. I have a passion for web development and enjoy building and using APIs, building frameworks, analyzing large datasets, and addressing scalability issues. I have interned at Fleis & VandenBrink Engineering in Grand Rapids, MI for 3 months as an Information Technology Intern and AdvantageCS in Ann Arbor, MI for 16 months as a Software Development Intern. I currently work for Capital One as an Associate Software Engineer. In my spare time I like to work on personal web development projects, play viola and drums, record and produce music, watch documentaries, and play Super Smash Bros. Melee.
